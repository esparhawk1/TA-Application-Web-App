2. Test




User Interface
* Rendering application form complete - Assigned to Andrew Peth [Unpolished UI Completed, backend functionality in progress]
http://php-sweteame.rhcloud.com/index.php/Form_controller
        Tasks to accomplish this milestone:
1. Create a PHP and HTML form with all the fields from the TA paper application.
2. Make this form a callable ‘view’ for the CodeIgniter MVC framework.
3. Create a controller to load the view and pass submitted information to the model and database. 
Issues Ran Into: Was unable to connect to database, so the function calls in Form_controller $this->load->database(); was causing the form to crash and display an error saying error at config/Loader.php on line 346. Essentially this means our credentials are incorrect. To fix this, I commented this out. I then ran into the problem of the controller being unable to locate the model I created, again I commented out the $this->load->model(‘Form_model’); to avoid crashing the UI. The task of submitting all information from the application MVC into the database as well as getting the database to connect successfully will be completed during Sprint 2 along with the rest of the database submission functionality (login, application submission, admin, instructor). CSS and polishing of the form will be done during Sprint 2 as well.






Testing Scenarios Documentation - Assigned to Chantal Lewis [Completed]
* Develop testing scenarios documented on separate Wiki page, linked to all sprints
        Tasks to accomplish this milestone:
1. Brain storm UI testing scenarios, document.
2. Brain storm controller/backend testing scenarios, document.
3. Brain storm Database testing scenarios, document.
4. Execute scenarios.

Task: Create application form UI (Form_view) located here: http://php-sweteame.rhcloud.com/index.php/Form_controller
I created a form_view that has most of the form elements - the rest of the fields such as classes taken previously, classes wanted to be taken, classes they want to teach will be taken from the CS course catalog and added to drop down boxes for applicant selection (this will be completed during Sprint 2.) I then created a Form_controller with form validation, xss protection, and a form_model to store the data in the database. (Model and controller need further debugging)

Tasks from Sprint 1 to be moved to Sprint 2
1. The task of submitting all information from the TA application form’s MVC into the database as well as getting the database to connect successfully will be completed during Sprint 2 along with the rest of the database submission functionality (login, application submission, admin, instructor). The controller and model need to be debugged fully.
   1. Reason: OpenShift made it difficult to test all of these components without multiple merges with master since master is the production server, master is the only development area we have been able to set up successfully. Research into creating our own accounts and servers with their own clone of the application to develop and test apart from the master production server is in progress and will hopefully be implemented soon to avoid this troublesome problem.


1. CSS and polishing of the form will be done during Sprint 2.
2. Addition of drop down boxes containing the CS course catalog for applicants to select courses they have previously taught, are currently teaching, and want to teach will be implemented into the form during Sprint 2.
